This is "Shelly", my own POSIX compliant shell. It follows the
["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview) on Codecrafters.io.

# Running the shell

1. Ensure you have `cargo (1.82)` installed locally
2. Run `./your_program.sh` to run the shell, which is implemented in
   `src/main.rs`. This command compiles the Rust project, so it might be slow
   the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
